    <p>
        By integrating GIS and Remote Sensing technologies, BUWASA enhances its ability to monitor, predict, and resolve water leakage more efficiently.
        These tools allow us to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify high-risk leak zones</li>
        <li>Map water infrastructure and coverage</li>
        <li>Track environmental impacts using remote data</li>
        <li>Improve communication between field technicians and control centers</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This integrated approach leads to better service delivery, and improved customer satisfaction.
    </p>
